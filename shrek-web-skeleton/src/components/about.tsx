            Shrek is green ogre with brown eyes. He wears a white long sleeved tunic within his brown turtle designed mini vest, brown pinstriped pants and dark short boots with a rip folded design in each side. While rescuing Fiona from the tower, he wears pieces of knight armor.</p>
        <p>
        In Shrek 2, when he was transformed into a human after drinking the Happily Ever After Potion, Shrek became a tall and muscular man with short dark brown hair with a single fringe sprouted on the left side. He also gained a cleanly shaved beard.

            While a human, Shrek disregarded his now-baggy clothes for a brown, sleeveless armor shirt with an olive green trim and markings of leaves, along with a white long sleeved tunic. He also wears olive green pants and brown short boots with a light brown, folded design in each side.
